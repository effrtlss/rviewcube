A new year, a new post. Just think how much you spend to take one class at UW-Milwaukee. Now think about the instructor for a second. Maybe you know something about them or maybe you don't.  But for how much money you're about to drop on the next fifteen weeks, you should know something about their teaching style.  We've all had great professors and we've all had terrible professors. The key is knowing ahead of time which is which. That where Rviewcube comes in. Share the experience you've had at UW-Milwaukee with fellow students.  Tell your friends to share their experiences. Review, rate, and recommend UW-Milwaukee professors on rviewcube so that we can all learn from each other before we learn from our professors. 

To kick off the new year, leave a comment below and let us know who your favorite UW-Milwaukee professor has been.
