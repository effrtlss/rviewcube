<h2>About Review Cube</h2>
<h3>Rate, review, and recommend UW-Milwaukee instructors!</h3>
Review Cube was built by Joel DesArmo, a student in the School of Information Studies at UW-Milwaukee, to rate, review, and recommend UW-Milwaukee instructors. The site currently has nearly 1,900 UW-Milwaukee instructors in its database arranged into all of UWM’s schools and colleges, which include 97 different academic departments. The instructors in the database are associated with close to 2,000 different courses taught at UWM. Data was obtained from the UWM Office of Assessment and Institutional Research. The listings on Review Cube also include the average GPA for one of the classes the instructor taught in Spring 2012.

College is expensive, so selecting the best instructors is important. Knowing which instructor to spend $1,000 on should involve the same kind of things as deciding which $50 coffee maker to buy or which $10 movie to see…asking friends and reading online reviews. The difference is that with a $1,000 class, it’s like a hundred times more important to get good information from a variety of people that have had the experience.
