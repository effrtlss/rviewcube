Just think how much you spend to take one class at UWM. Now think about the instructor for a second. Maybe you know something about them or maybe you don't. But for how much money you're about to drop on the next fifteen weeks, you should know something about their teaching style. We've all had great professors and we've all had terrible professors. The key is knowing ahead of time which is which. That's where Review Cube comes in. Share the experience you've had at UW-Milwaukee with fellow students.
